# Zotcourse

by Tristan Jogminas

This was forked from [Antplanner2](https://github.com/gumho/antplanner2) by Ryan Hsu
Unfortunetly it appears that Antplanner2 is no longer being maintained so I have decided to maintain it here.
Please feel free to make a PR and contribute!

## Goals

1. Pane slider <em>Completed</em>
2. Query antplanner if schedule name not found <em>Completed</em>
3. Easy selection of course codes <em>In Progress</em>
4. Export to iCal file
5. Multiple schedules assigned to one name
    a. Possibly connected to Google authen
6. Pick course color
7. More to come...
